"aboutAnswer":"Avocado, a tree likely originating from south-central Mexico, is classified as a member of the flowering plant family Lauraceae.\nThe fruit of the plant, also called an avocado, is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed.\nAvocados are commercially valuable and are cultivated in tropical and Mediterranean climates throughout the world.\nThey have a green-skinned, fleshy body that may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or spherical. Commercially, they ripen after harvesting. Avocado trees are partially self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain predictable fruit quality and quantity.\nIn 2017, Mexico produced 34% of the world supply of avocados.\nThe fruit of horticultural cultivars has a markedly higher fat content than most other fruit, mostly monounsaturated fat, and as such serves as an important staple in the diet of consumers who have limited access to other fatty foods (high-fat meats and fish, dairy products). Having a high smoke point, avocado oil is expensive compared to common salad and cooking oils, and is mostly used for salads or dips.\nThe fruit is not sweet, but distinctly and subtly flavored, with smooth texture. It is used in both savory and sweet dishes, though in many countries not for both. The avocado is common in vegetarian cuisine as a substitute for meats in sandwiches and salads because of its high fat content."
