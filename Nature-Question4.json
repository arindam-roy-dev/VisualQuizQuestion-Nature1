"aboutAnswer":"A tuna (also called tunny) is a saltwater fish that belongs to the tribe Thunnini, a subgrouping of the Scombridae (mackerel) family.\nTuna, opah, and mackerel sharks are the only species of fish that can maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water.\nFound in warm seas, it is extensively fished commercially, and is popular as a game fish. As a result of overfishing, stocks of some tuna species, such as the southern bluefin tuna, are close to extinction."
