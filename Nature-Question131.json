"aboutAnswer":"Bamboos are a diverse group of evergreen perennial flowering plants in the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae.\nIn bamboo, as in other grasses, the internodal regions of the stem are usually hollow and the vascular bundles in the cross-section are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical arrangement.\nThe dicotyledonous woody xylem is also absent. The absence of secondary growth wood causes the stems of monocots, including the palms and large bamboos, to be columnar rather than tapering.\nBamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants in the world, due to a unique rhizome-dependent system.\nBamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, being used for building materials, as a food source, and as a versatile raw product.\nBamboo, like wood, is a natural composite material with a high strength-to-weight ratio useful for structures.\nBamboo\'s strength-to-weight ratio is similar to timber, and its strength is generally similar to a strong softwood or hardwood timber.\nMost bamboo species are native to warm and moist tropical and to warm temperate climates. However, many species are found in diverse climates, ranging from hot tropical regions to cool mountainous regions and highland cloud forests."
