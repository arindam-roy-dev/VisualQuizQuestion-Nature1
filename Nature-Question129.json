"aboutAnswer":"The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant. All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a \"corm\".\nPlants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for trees, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a false stem or pseudostem.\nBananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60 centimetres (2.0 ft) deep, has good drainage and is not compacted. The leaves of banana plants are composed of a \"stalk\" (petiole) and a blade (lamina).\nWhen a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or inflorescence. A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top. Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence, also known as the \"banana heart\".\nAfter fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base, so that the plant as a whole is perennial. In the plantation system of cultivation, only one of the offshoots will be allowed to develop in order to maintain spacing.\nThe inflorescence contains many bracts (sometimes incorrectly referred to as petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear in rows further up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary is inferior, meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the ovary.\nThe banana fruits develop from the banana heart, in a large hanging cluster, made up of tiers (called \"hands\"), with up to 20 fruit to a tier."
