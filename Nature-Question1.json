"aboutAnswer":"If you use a Windows computer you may end up with different results. This is possibly due to the way Windows handles newlines. Essentially, if you have just newline characters in your JSON and paste it into JSONLint from a Windows computer, it may validate it as valid erroneously since Windows may need a carriage return as well to detect newlines properly. As a solution, either use direct URL input, or make sure your content's newlines match the architecture your system expects!"
