The genus is quite large, comprising several hundred species that are native to warm temperate, subtropical and tropical regions throughout the world. Member species are renowned for their large, showy flowers and those species are commonly known simply as \"hibiscus\", or less widely known as rose mallow. Other names include hardy hibiscus, rose of sharon, and tropical hibiscus.\nSeveral species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, notably Hibiscus syriacus and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis.\nA tea made from hibiscus flowers is known by many names around the world and is served both hot and cold.
