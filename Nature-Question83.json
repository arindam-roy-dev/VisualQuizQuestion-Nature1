"aboutAnswer":"A bee has two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs.\nIn most bees, the front wings are larger than their back wings.\nAnother cool little wing fact? Bees have a row of hooks called hamuli, which connect the front and back wings so they can beat simultaneously when the bee is flying. The wings are synchronised in flight, and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing."
